# Consumer-Report

## Consumer Complaints and Financial Institutions
I use the data provided by [**Consumer Financial Protection Bureau**](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) to analyze the relationship between  consumers and the financial insitutions (banks, credit companies, ...). This [database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) reports the complaints filed by individuals from 2011 to 2016. 

Questions such as: 

1. Average wait time for complaints to be sent to company, 
2. Complaints resolution rate for each company
3. Companies ranked by the most number of complaints (per capita), 
4. Complaints by geographical considerations, i.e. US states
5. Word-Cloud analyses to understand the main issues repoted by the consumers

and many more questions and informative graphs.  

**Requirements:**

- pandas
- matplotlib
- Basemap
- csv
- wordcloud
- numpy
- Image
- path
- random
